Cypher v4.6: Re-Engineering AI Defense for Irish Schools
​Project: Edutech OWASP AI Author: Sean BurkeTags: #OWASP #AISecurity #Compliance #Blockchain #Edutech​Introduction: The Problem of AI Safety in Education
​When I joined the Edutech OWASP AI project as a contributor, I was met with a complex challenge. Coming from an Operations and Compliance background—working with enterprise platforms like SAP XML datamodels and Microsoft ecosystems—I was tasked with a vision that felt worlds apart: building a secure, two-persona AI for secondary schools.​The goal was to blend my professional experience in content moderation and operations with my passion for Japanese subculture and anime to create
:The “Vtuber” Persona: An engaging assistant giving fun tidbits and school help.​The “Guardian” Persona: A background layer hardening schoolkid devices.​Originally, I thought the persona was the goal. I quickly realized the true mission was Operational Integrity. My CASP+ training prepared me for traditional vulnerabilities, but AI “Adversarial Poetry” was a different beast.​ AI like any tech has layers of cyber threats while I did read the guidelines and write ups how do I include it.
The Cypher Initiative: A New Ethical Framework​
The Cypher Initiative is a non-profit, open-source pilot designed to re-engineer security and ethical governance within a closed, local school network.​1. Dual-Layer AI Defense (NDLF)​To move past the “RP (Role-Play) vibes” of version 1, I developed Neurodiverse Logic (NDLF). By treating AI prompts like SAP XML data packets, we can strip away the “style” to reveal the intent.​
The Problem: A user or hacker can use “Adversarial Poetry” or rhyming schemes to bypass standard safety filters.
​The Fix: A Python-XML workflow that enforces behavior. If a student tries to “jailbreak” the AI, the system pivots from the helpful Vtuber to the “Dublin Destroyer” mode—blocking the user and logging the event to the SIEM.​2. The Local Blockchain & GDPR​Compliance is at the heart of Cypher. We use a local blockchain for two critical use cases:​Ephemeral PII: Student identity data is stored locally. To remain GDPR compliant, the ledger is hardcoded to self-delete every 5 days.​The Token Economy: We created a local pseudo-crypto token.​Positive Reinforcement: AI gives tasks (e.g., “Harden your device” or “Volunteer in class”).​Teacher Validation: Once a teacher “OKs” the task, a token is minted for the student.​Technical Benchmarks: Encryption is being handled by a developer 
For myself this isnt a matter of writing prompts this getting it battle tested
xml is also very heavy in token usage reducing it we are looking ahead
